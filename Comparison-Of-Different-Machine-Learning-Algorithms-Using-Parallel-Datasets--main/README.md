# Comparison-Of-Machine-Learning-Using-Parallel-dataset
Six Machine Learning Algorithms Are Compared Using Diabetes Dataset And Accuracy is Determined For Each

As the Diabetes Dataset is Divided into 3 Parts For the better Accuracy of the model 

Results:

For the first dataset the accuracy of the Decision tree is greater than all the other algorithms (73.18 %). For the second dataset accuracy of Naive Bayes is greater than the other algorithms (77.55 %). For the third dataset the accuracy of the Random Forest Algorithm is greater than the other algorithm (72.36%).

Overall Performance:
Existing machine learning models and their comparison with the proposed work is given in Table 3. Seen that Naive Bayes gives the highest accuracy than the other algorithm (77.55%). It depends as per the dataset which algorithm is better for which dataset. For the first dataset, the Decision tree is best for second dataset Naive Bayes and for third dataset Random Forest gives better accuracy.
